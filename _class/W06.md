# Week 06 — Shape and Space: SDFs and Raymarching

**Course:** Vibecoding GLSL Shaders | CalArts Program in Experimental Animation

## Where We Are

We move from 2D into 3D. Signed distance fields (SDFs) let you describe shapes mathematically — spheres, boxes, toruses — and raymarching renders them without traditional 3D geometry. The results feel sculptural and cinematic.

## Topics

- What is a signed distance field?
- Basic SDF primitives: sphere, box, torus, plane
- Combining shapes: union, intersection, smooth blend
- Raymarching: walking a ray through the scene
- Lighting and materials in a raymarched world
