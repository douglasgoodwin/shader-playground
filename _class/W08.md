# Week 08 — Composition and Layering

**Course:** Vibecoding GLSL Shaders | CalArts Program in Experimental Animation

## Where We Are

You have a toolbox of techniques — noise, SDFs, audio-reactivity, warps, tiles. Now we focus on composing them into complete pieces. How do you structure a visual experience over time? How do you transition between states? How do you build tension and release?

## Topics

- Blending and compositing multiple shader layers
- Transitions: crossfades, wipes, dissolves in shader code
- Structuring a piece over time: sections, builds, drops
- Color grading and post-processing effects
- When to stop: the art of restraint
