# Week 08 — Composition and Layering

**Course:** Vibecoding GLSL Shaders | CalArts Program in Experimental Animation

## Where We Are

You have a toolbox of techniques — noise, SDFs, audio-reactivity, warps, tiles. Now we focus on composing them into complete pieces. How do you structure a visual experience over time? How do you transition between states? How do you build tension and release?

We'll study John Whitney's *Catalog* (1961) as a model: a single film that sequences spirals, dot grids, wave interference, Lissajous figures, and color cycling into a coherent whole.

## Topics

- Blending and compositing multiple shader layers
- Transitions: crossfades, wipes, dissolves in shader code
- Structuring a piece over time: sections, builds, drops
- Color grading and post-processing effects
- When to stop: the art of restraint
- Studying *Catalog*: how Whitney sequences variety without chaos

## Exercise

Recreate a 60–90 second excerpt from Whitney's *Catalog* using techniques from the codebase (the `/whitney/` section, exercise shaders, playground effects, or your own variations). The goal is not a pixel-perfect replica but a study in composition: how do you sequence multiple visual ideas into a piece that holds together? Record your version and write a short reflection comparing your choices to Whitney's.
