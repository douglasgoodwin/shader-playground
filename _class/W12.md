# Week 12 — Final Project: Studio 2

**Course:** Vibecoding GLSL Shaders | CalArts Program in Experimental Animation

## Where We Are

Deep in production. Focus shifts from "does it work?" to "does it feel right?" — refining timing, color, transitions, and the overall arc of the piece. Peer feedback session midway through class.

## Goals

- Refine and iterate on your piece
- Peer feedback: show work-in-progress, give and receive notes
- Begin thinking about presentation format and timing for the Bijou
