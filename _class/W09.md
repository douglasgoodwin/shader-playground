# Week 09 — Performance and Live Visuals

**Course:** Vibecoding GLSL Shaders | CalArts Program in Experimental Animation

## Where We Are

The Bijou show will be a live event. This week we think about shaders as performance — controlling parameters in real time, responding to a room, and making decisions on the fly.

## Topics

- Real-time control: mouse, keyboard, MIDI, OSC
- Designing for liveness: what parameters to expose
- Performing with shaders: rehearsal, timing, improvisation
- Recording and capturing live output
- The Bijou space: projection, aspect ratio, scale

## Exercise

*Exercise to come.*
