# Week 03 — The Exercise Shaders

**Course:** Vibecoding GLSL Shaders | CalArts Program in Experimental Animation

## Where We Are

We dive into the exercise shaders (ex1–ex11) as a guided tour of fundamental techniques: color, shape, noise, patterns, animation. These are your learning specimens — study them, break them, remix them.

## Topics

- Walking through exercises: coordinate systems, SDF shapes, noise, FBM
- How to read GLSL even if you can't write it from scratch
- Using the LLM to annotate and explain unfamiliar code
- Mixing and matching: taking a technique from one exercise into another
- The Lygia shader library: many of our shaders use `#include "lygia/..."` for noise, random, and color functions — understanding what these includes provide

## Exercise

1. Work through at least 4 of the exercise shaders (ex1–ex11).
2. For each one, use an LLM to explain it, then make at least one meaningful modification.
3. Create one "mashup" shader that combines ideas from two different exercises.
4. Bring your mashup to class for a short show-and-tell.
