# Week 05 — Noise, Pattern, Texture

**Course:** Vibecoding GLSL Shaders | CalArts Program in Experimental Animation

## Where We Are

With the vibecoding loop established, we go deeper into generative imagery. Noise functions are the raw material of organic-looking shaders — clouds, fire, terrain, fabric. This week we learn to wield them.

## Topics

- Noise functions: random, value noise, simplex noise
- Layering noise with FBM (fractal Brownian motion)
- Tiling and repetition: `fract()`, `mod()`, grids
- Mapping noise to color, displacement, and opacity

## Exercise

*Exercise to come.*
