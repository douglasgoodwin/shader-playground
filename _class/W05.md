# Week 05 — Git, GitHub & Noise

**Course:** Vibecoding GLSL Shaders | CalArts Program in Experimental Animation

## Where We Are

Two tracks this week. First, a practical Git and GitHub tutorial: moving beyond basic commits to the workflows you'll need for the rest of the course and your final project. Second, a deeper dive into noise — the raw material of organic-looking shaders (clouds, fire, terrain, fabric).

## Git/GitHub Topics

- Repositories and remotes: your local repo vs. GitHub
- Branching and merging: working on experiments without breaking your main code
- Writing useful commit messages (what changed and why, not just "update")
- Pushing to GitHub: sharing your work and keeping a backup
- Reading diffs: understanding what changed between versions
- Using Git history to recover previous versions
- How version control supports your prompt log (every commit is a snapshot you can return to)

## Noise Topics

- Noise functions: random, value noise, simplex noise
- Layering noise with FBM (fractal Brownian motion)
- Tiling and repetition: `fract()`, `mod()`, grids
- Mapping noise to color, displacement, and opacity
- The Lygia library's `snoise()` and `random()` functions

## Exercises

1. **Git Practice:** Create a branch, make a shader change, commit with a descriptive message, and push to GitHub. Practice reverting a change.
2. **Noise Study:** Starting from ex10 (Value Noise, Gradient Noise, or FBM), create a variation that uses noise in a way that wasn't in the original — mapped to color, used as displacement, or layered as texture. Document the process in your prompt log.
