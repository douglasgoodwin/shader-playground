# Week 01 — Welcome to Vibecoding

**Course:** Vibecoding GLSL Shaders | CalArts Program in Experimental Animation

## Where We Are

First day. We introduce the course concept: using LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek) as creative collaborators to write GLSL shader code — something that normally takes years to learn. By the end of 14 weeks you will have a body of visual work and a live performance in the Bijou theater.

We begin by looking at the tradition we're entering: visual music — the genre of experimental film that uses animation, abstract imagery, and motion synchronized to (or evoking) musical structures.

## Topics

- What is a shader? The GPU pipeline in 60 seconds
- The course toolkit: Vite, vite-plugin-glsl, the browser console
- First encounter with an LLM code assistant
- Running `npm run dev` and seeing your first fragment shader
- Survey of visual music history and key artists

## Exercise: Visual Music Research (5 points)

Explore the world of visual music — the genre of experimental film that uses animation, abstract imagery, and motion synchronized to (or evoking) musical structures.

### Artists to Explore

- **John Whitney** — *Catalog*, *Permutations*, *Arabesque*, *Matrix*, *Lapis*
- **James Whitney** — *Lapis*, *Yantra*, *Wu Ming*
- **Mary Ellen Bute** — *Rhythm in Light*, *Synchromy*, *Mood Contrasts*
- **Len Lye** — *A Colour Box*, *Free Radicals*, *Particles in Space*
- **Jordan Belson** — *Allures*, *Samadhi*, *Chakra*
- **Oskar Fischinger** — *Komposition in Blau*, *An Optical Poem*, *Motion Painting No. 1*
- **Norman McLaren** — *Dots*, *Loops*, *Synchromy*
- **Lillian Schwartz** — *Pixillation*, *UFOs*, *Metamorphosis*

### Where to Look

- YouTube (search artist names + "visual music" or film titles)
- Vimeo
- [Center for Visual Music](https://www.centerforvisualmusic.org)
- UbuWeb (ubu.com)

### What to Do

1. **Watch** at least 3 different pieces by different artists (spend at least 30 minutes total).

2. **Take notes** on each piece:
   - Title and artist
   - What shapes, patterns, or movements do you see?
   - How would you describe the motion? (pulsing, spiraling, oscillating, flowing, etc.)
   - What's the relationship between the visuals and any sound/music?
   - What draws your attention? What's surprising or beautiful?

3. **Choose one piece** (or a specific moment from a piece) that you'd like to try to replicate with shader code.

### What to Submit

A short written response (200–400 words) that includes:

- **Brief notes** on the 3+ pieces you watched
- **Your chosen piece** — which one do you want to replicate?
- **Description** — How would you describe it to someone (or to Claude) who hasn't seen it? Be specific about:
  - The shapes involved
  - How they move
  - How they're arranged (grid, spiral, random, etc.)
  - Color and how it changes
  - Any patterns or rhythms you notice

## Exercise: Install the Server

Get the shader-playground running on your machine so you're ready to code next week.

### 0. Setting Up Node.js on macOS

If you don't have Node.js installed, use **nvm** (Node Version Manager):

**Install nvm:**

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
```

**Configure your shell** by adding these lines to `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc` if using bash):

```bash
touch ~/.zshrc

export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
```

**Reload your shell and install Node:**

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
nvm install --lts
```

If nvm installs the wrong versions, reinstall with:

```bash
nvm install --reinstall-packages-from=node node
nvm current
npm -v
```

### 1. Download the Source Code

**Option A — Git** (recommended, though you will need to install git):

```bash
cd ~/_CODE
git clone https://github.com/douglasgoodwin/shader-playground.git
cd shader-playground
```

**Option B — ZIP download:**

1. Visit https://github.com/douglasgoodwin/shader-playground in a browser and download the ZIP.
2. Unzip it somewhere under your home directory (for example `~/_CODE/shader-playground`).
3. In Terminal:

```bash
cd ~/_CODE/shader-playground
```

Now `pwd` should end with `shader-playground`.

### 2. Install Node Dependencies Locally

From inside `shader-playground`:

```bash
npm install
```

- This reads `package.json` and `package-lock.json` and installs everything into `./node_modules` in this directory.
- Nothing is installed globally; no admin access is needed.
- (If installation errors mention missing Node/npm, you need some Node in PATH — Herd, nvm, or lab setup — but it doesn't matter which for this project.)

### 3. Run the Dev Server (Vite)

Still in `shader-playground`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- This runs the `dev` script from `package.json`, which calls `vite` from `./node_modules/.bin`.
- A URL (often http://localhost:5173/) will be printed; open it in your browser to see the shader playground.
- To stop the dev server, hit **Ctrl+C** in the terminal.

### That's It!

Try it out: http://localhost:5173/

The rest of the instructions below are here if you want to build working HTML files for a website.

### 4. Build and Preview (Optional)

**Build a production bundle:**

```bash
npm run build
```

**Preview the built site locally:**

```bash
npm run preview
```

These scripts call `vite build` and `vite preview` from the local `node_modules`.

### 5. Run the Linter (Optional)

```bash
npm run lint
```

This runs `eslint src` using the local ESLint and the `eslint.config.js` in the project.

### 6. Verify Everything Is Local to the Project

From inside `shader-playground`:

```bash
npm root
ls node_modules/.bin | grep -E 'vite|eslint'
```

- `npm root` should print a path ending in `shader-playground/node_modules`.
- The `ls` command should show `vite` and `eslint` in `node_modules/.bin`, confirming tools are installed only for this project.

If you like, run through these steps now and paste any command output that doesn't match what you expect.
