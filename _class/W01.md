# Week 01 — Welcome to Vibecoding

**Course:** Vibecoding GLSL Shaders | CalArts Program in Experimental Animation

## Where We Are

First day. We introduce the course concept: using LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek) as creative collaborators to write inspectable graphics code (GLSL shaders). We will treat AI as a drafting and debugging partner, not as a system that produces finished images for you. The goal is to keep artistic decisions legible: you can read the code, revise it, and explain what it is doing.

We also establish baseline norms for authorship, attribution, and responsible use of AI, including avoiding "in the style of" prompts and avoiding workflows that appropriate other artists' intellectual property or signature looks.

By the end of 14 weeks you will have a body of visual work and a live performance in the Bijou theater.

We begin by looking at the tradition we're entering: visual music — the genre of experimental film that uses animation, abstract imagery, and motion synchronized to (or evoking) musical structures.

## Topics

- What is a shader? The GPU pipeline in 60 seconds
- The course toolkit: Vite, vite-plugin-glsl, the browser console
- First encounter with an LLM code assistant
- Running `npm run dev` and seeing your first fragment shader
- Visual music history and key artists (see the `/whitney/` section for working code inspired by Whitney's films)
- The vibecoding loop: intent, minimal change requests, testing, and iteration
- Documentation norms: prompt logs and version history

## Exercise: Visual Music Research (5 points)

Explore the world of visual music — the genre of experimental film that uses animation, abstract imagery, and motion synchronized to (or evoking) musical structures.

### Artists to Explore

- **John Whitney** — *Catalog*, *Permutations*, *Arabesque*, *Matrix*, *Lapis*
- **James Whitney** — *Lapis*, *Yantra*, *Wu Ming*
- **Mary Ellen Bute** — *Rhythm in Light*, *Synchromy*, *Mood Contrasts*
- **Len Lye** — *A Colour Box*, *Free Radicals*, *Particles in Space*
- **Jordan Belson** — *Allures*, *Samadhi*, *Chakra*
- **Oskar Fischinger** — *Komposition in Blau*, *An Optical Poem*, *Motion Painting No. 1*
- **Norman McLaren** — *Dots*, *Loops*, *Synchromy*
- **Lillian Schwartz** — *Pixillation*, *UFOs*, *Metamorphosis*

### Where to Look

- YouTube (search artist names + "visual music" or film titles)
- Vimeo
- [Center for Visual Music](https://www.centerforvisualmusic.org)
- UbuWeb (ubu.com)

### What to Do

1. **Watch** at least 3 different pieces by different artists (spend at least 30 minutes total).

2. **Take notes** on each piece:
   - Title and artist
   - What shapes, patterns, or movements do you see?
   - How would you describe the motion? (pulsing, spiraling, oscillating, flowing, etc.)
   - What's the relationship between the visuals and any sound/music?
   - What draws your attention? What's surprising or beautiful?

3. **Choose one piece** (or a specific moment from a piece) that you'd like to study with shader code.

### What to Submit

A short written response (200–400 words) that includes:

- **Brief notes** on the 3+ pieces you watched
- **Your chosen piece** — which one do you want to study?
- **Description** — Focus on observable form (motion, rhythm, palette, structure) rather than stylistic imitation. Be specific about:
  - The shapes involved
  - How they move
  - How they're arranged (grid, spiral, random, etc.)
  - Color and how it changes
  - Any patterns or rhythms you notice

## Exercise: Install the Server

Get the shader-playground running on your machine so you're ready to code next week.

### 0. Setting Up Node.js on macOS

If you don't have Node.js installed, use **nvm** (Node Version Manager):

**Install nvm:**

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
```

**Configure your shell** by adding these lines to `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc` if using bash):

```bash
touch ~/.zshrc

export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
```

**Reload your shell and install Node:**

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
nvm install --lts
```

If nvm installs the wrong versions, reinstall with:

```bash
nvm install --reinstall-packages-from=node node
nvm current
npm -v
```

### 1. Download the Source Code

**Option A — Git** (recommended, though you will need to install git):

```bash
cd ~/_CODE
git clone https://github.com/douglasgoodwin/shader-playground.git
cd shader-playground
```

**Option B — ZIP download:**

1. Visit https://github.com/douglasgoodwin/shader-playground in a browser and download the ZIP.
2. Unzip it somewhere under your home directory (for example `~/_CODE/shader-playground`).
3. In Terminal:

```bash
cd ~/_CODE/shader-playground
```

Now `pwd` should end with `shader-playground`.

### 2. Install Node Dependencies Locally

From inside `shader-playground`:

```bash
npm install
```

- This reads `package.json` and `package-lock.json` and installs everything into `./node_modules` in this directory.
- Nothing is installed globally; no admin access is needed.
- (If installation errors mention missing Node/npm, you need some Node in PATH — Herd, nvm, or lab setup — but it doesn't matter which for this project.)

### 3. Run the Dev Server (Vite)

Still in `shader-playground`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- This runs the `dev` script from `package.json`, which calls `vite` from `./node_modules/.bin`.
- A URL (often http://localhost:5173/) will be printed; open it in your browser to see the shader playground.
- To stop the dev server, hit **Ctrl+C** in the terminal.

### That's It!

Try it out: http://localhost:5173/

The rest of the instructions below are here if you want to build working HTML files for a website.

### 4. Build and Preview (Optional)

**Build a production bundle:**

```bash
npm run build
```

**Preview the built site locally:**

```bash
npm run preview
```

These scripts call `vite build` and `vite preview` from the local `node_modules`.

### 5. Run the Linter (Optional)

```bash
npm run lint
```

This runs `eslint src` using the local ESLint and the `eslint.config.js` in the project.

### 6. Verify Everything Is Local to the Project

From inside `shader-playground`:

```bash
npm root
ls node_modules/.bin | grep -E 'vite|eslint'
```

- `npm root` should print a path ending in `shader-playground/node_modules`.
- The `ls` command should show `vite` and `eslint` in `node_modules/.bin`, confirming tools are installed only for this project.

If you like, run through these steps now and paste any command output that doesn't match what you expect.

## Exercise: Prompt Log Setup

Create your Prompt Log file and complete one entry for your first edit, even if it is small.

**File name suggestion:** `prompt-log.md` (in your project repo)

Use the Prompt Log Template from the syllabus. Each entry should include: what you wanted to change, what you asked the LLM, what changed in the code, what you tested, and the result. This log will be a running document throughout the semester — start it now so the habit is established early.
