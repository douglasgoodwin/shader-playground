# Week 10 — Final Project Pitch

**Course:** Vibecoding GLSL Shaders | CalArts Program in Experimental Animation

## Where We Are

Time to commit. You propose your final project for the Bijou show — what you'll make, what techniques you'll use, and how you'll present it. Pitches are short, visual, and honest about scope.

## Topics

- Scoping a project: what's achievable in four weeks?
- Writing a concept statement
- Identifying technical risks early
- Peer feedback on pitches

## Exercise

Prepare and present a short pitch (3–5 minutes) for your final project:

- **Concept:** What is the piece? What's the experience for the audience?
- **Techniques:** Which shader techniques will you use?
- **Audio:** Will it be audio-reactive? To what music or sound?
- **Format:** Pre-rendered video, live performance, or hybrid?
- **Risks:** What's the hardest part? What's your fallback plan?
