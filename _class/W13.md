# Week 13 — Final Project: Rehearsal

**Course:** Vibecoding GLSL Shaders | CalArts Program in Experimental Animation

## Where We Are

Tech rehearsal in the Bijou theater. We test projection, audio, timing, and transitions between pieces. This is where the show comes together as a collective experience.

## Goals

- Tech run in the Bijou: projection setup, audio check, lighting
- Run each piece in presentation conditions
- Finalize show order and transitions
- Last chance for adjustments before the show
