## Vibecoding allows artists to write sophisticated code. Who Benefits from the Disruption?

*Disruption always announces itself as progress: a better tool, a faster method, an improvement. It never says who benefits when the frame starts running.*

The Luddites get a bad rap. They were skilled textile workers responding to wage cuts, unemployment, and the way new machinery was being deployed against them. The machines mattered less than what they enabled: the sudden reorganization of labor in which livelihoods were treated as disposable. When Parliament responded by making the destruction of textile frames a capital crime, it demonstrated how quickly the state could mobilize to protect property and machinery, while leaving displaced workers to absorb the consequences. Whatever your politics, it is clear that technological change was not simply technical: it was enforced through law and punishment.

Lord Byron recognized this distinction in his [1812 speech to the House of Lords](https://revolutionsnewsstand.com/2024/06/02/first-speech-of-lord-byron-voice-of-the-great-poet-raised-in-defense-of-the-proletariat-from-the-worker-new-york-vol-15-no-29-october-14-1905/) opposing the Frame Breaking Act. He did not argue against mechanical improvement. Instead, he questioned the expectation that workers should welcome innovations that rendered them *superfluous.* Byron drew attention to the way poverty and distress were being punished as crimes, while the structural causes of that distress went unexamined. His point was not that machines were evil, but that efficiency alone could not be a measure of justice.

[A stocking frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stocking_frame) was a mechanical knitting machine invented in the 16th century. It was adapted to knit cotton, produce lace, and perform ribbing, becoming one of the first engines of industrial textile production. Framework knitting marked a decisive shift in the organization of textile work: skilled labor was reorganized around a machine that accelerated output while reshaping wages, standards, and control.

But the frame was never just a machine. It was a system: a set of rules, tools, and constraints that determined how work was done, who was allowed to do it, and who benefited from the results. Once a frame was in place, individual actions took place inside its logic. Even resistance had to contend with its structure.

From the stocking frames of early industrial textile production to the algorithmic frames that structure contemporary software, and now to AI tooling frames that mediate creative work itself, the pattern is consistent: technical systems do not merely speed up labor, they reorganize who works, how value is produced, and who captures its rewards.

[Cory Doctorow's contemporary critique of corporate AI](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/18/tech-ai-bubble-burst-reverse-centaur) echoes this structure, albeit in a very different historical context. He argues that much of the current AI boom is shaped less by demonstrated usefulness than by speculative investment and the anticipated reduction of labor costs. Like the industrial machines Byron described, AI systems are often framed as inevitable improvements, while their social effects (deskilling, downward pressure on wages, and market saturation) are treated as regrettable and unavoidable. Resistance, Doctorow notes, is frequently dismissed as fear or nostalgia, even as accountability for errors and risks continues to fall on human workers.

Artists know the drill. Creative labor is marked by debt, precarity, and expectations of unpaid or underpaid work justified by exposure or opportunity. New tools promise speed, empowerment, and autonomy. They arrive alongside raised expectations and thinner margins. Artists who struggle to keep up are told to adapt, while platforms and institutions remain in control. Financial instability looks like a personal failure rather than a structural condition.

[Vibecoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) enters here with real promise and real tension. Vibecoding is an approach to programming that uses conversational language, intention, and iterative dialogue with AI to shape computational behavior. It emphasizes exploration and expressive control over efficiency or optimization, treating code as a material to be steered and reinterpreted rather than a fixed script to be perfected. For an individual artist, this can feel genuinely liberating by collapsing technical barriers and enabling sophisticated work without large teams or specialized pipelines.

Byron’s question still applies. Tools that allow one person to do the work of many don’t just expand individual autonomy; they reshape the labor landscape around them. Vibecoding can thicken artistic agency, or it can quietly normalize a world where fewer people are expected to do more work for the same (or less) support. As Doctorow reminds us, technology alone does not determine which outcome prevails. Ownership, governance, and institutional choices do.

The question, then, is not whether to use these tools. It is how to use them without pretending the frame isn't already running.
