Before We Begin...

^ There's been a lot of discussion at CalArts about the role of AI

^ I've been collecting images of posters people are leaving around campus

^ I'm glad there's awareness—but we need *more* discussion

# Let's Talk About the Luddites

The textbook narrative: people who *refused* technology

A supposed moral failing or ignorance

**But this isn't really the case.**

---

# Lord Byron, 1812

Read his address to the House of Lords

You'll understand what the Luddites were actually about:

- Why they were smashing machines
- Their real attitudes toward technology
- The desperate position factory owners forced them into

---

# Not Exactly the Same

But there are many parallels worth discussing

Technology itself isn't the enemy

**Who controls it—and who benefits—matters**

---

# Required Reading

- My essay: `theluddites.md` in this repo
- Lord Byron's address to Parliament (1812)
- Cory Doctorow's essay in *The Guardian*

Bring your thoughts to class

---

# Now: What is VibeCoding?

Transform **poetry**, **photographs**, and **everyday objects** into dynamic animations with AI

Learn to *converse* with AI systems to fulfill your creative vision

---

# What You'll Learn

- Conversational programming skills
- Control animation, timing, and interaction through dialogue
- Translate poetic imagery into animated behaviors
- Particle systems & flocking movements
- Color morphs & procedural motion

---

# No Coding Experience Required

LLMs bridge the technical gap

You bring the **vision**
AI helps with the **syntax**

---

# Your Outputs

- Standalone animations
- Projection mapping pieces
- Components for integration with other creative software

---

# Our Tools

- **This shader playground** — experiment with GLSL
- **Claude Code** or similar LLM — your coding collaborator
- **VS Code** — where the magic happens

# Let's Begin

> "The goal is not to learn to code. The goal is to make things move."

**...while thinking critically about the tools we use.**
